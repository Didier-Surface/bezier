[Pierre Étienne Bézier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier) _Pierre Étienne BézierSeptember 1, 1910 – November 25, 1999; [ˈpjɛʁ eˈtjɛn beˈzje]) was a French engineer and one of the founders of the fields of solid, geometric and physical modeling as well as in the field of representing curves, especially in CAD/CAM systems.[1] As an engineer at Renault, he became a leader in the transformation of design and manufacturing, through mathematics and computing tools, into computer-aided design and three-dimensional modeling.[1]  Bézier patented and popularized, but did not invent[citation needed] the Bézier curves and Bézier surfaces that are now used in most computer-aided design and computer graphics systems._
